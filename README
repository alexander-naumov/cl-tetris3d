Yet another 3D tetris, but I think there's no such which is written in CL.

How to use:
Copy cl-tetris3d.asd into directory in which ASDF keeps its *.asd files.
Run command (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'cl-tetris3d) in your interpreter.
Now you can start to play (cl-tetris3d:run).
Enjoy!

Attention!
I've tested only under SBCL.
