Yet another 3D tetris, but I think there's no such which is written in CL.

How to use:
Copy cl-tetris3d.asd into directory in which ASDF keeps its *.asd files.
Run command (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :cl-tetris3d) in your interpreter.
Now you can start to play (cl-tetris3d:run).
Enjoy!

Make executable:
Run interpeter from shell(from slime it doesn't work).
Then run commands in repl:
> (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :cl-tetris3d)
> (cl-tetris3d:make-executable)
Or for sbcl you can run ./sbcl-make-executable.run
Now you can execute ./cl-tetris3d from shell and have fun!


Attention!
I've tested only under SBCL.
